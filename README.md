This repository contains the code for the STM32Cube IDE, backend classification, database creation, and different GUIs for the EMG hand movement classification final project.

## Introduction

This project focuses on the classification of EMG (Electromyography) signals to detect and classify hand movements. It involves various components such as the STM32Cube IDE code for signal acquisition, backend classification code for processing and classifying the signals, code for creating and managing the database, and different GUIs for visualizing the results.

The project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for EMG-based hand movement classification, allowing users to acquire EMG signals using STM32 microcontrollers, process the signals using the backend classification code, store the data in a database, and visualize the results through intuitive graphical user interfaces.

## Features

- Acquisition of EMG signals using the STM32Cube IDE code
- Backend classification code for processing and classifying EMG signals
- Database creation and management code for storing the acquired data
- Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for visualizing the classification results

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `STM32Cube_IDE_Code/`: Contains the code developed using STM32Cube IDE for signal acquisition.
- `Backend_Classification_Code/`: Contains the backend code for processing and classifying the acquired EMG signals.
- `Database_Code/`: Includes the code for creating and managing the database for storing the EMG data.
- `GUI_Code/`: Contains different GUI implementations for visualizing the classification results.

## Getting Started

To use this project, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-repo.git`
2. Set up the STM32Cube IDE and load the `STM32Cube_IDE_Code` onto your STM32 microcontroller.
3. Install the required dependencies for the backend classification code and run it.
